1. unzip the project
2. open project in IDE(we use webstorm)
3. run command : npm start this will install all needed dependencies which you can see also in package.json, and will setup local server that will be opened at localhost:8080 to run debug.
4. you can also use the command npm run buildwin to create dist folder which you can run the project from there.
5. webpack create watch for the project files so when you update any file it will be rendering it immediately no need to restart project.
6. notice to use project you need a valid environment with nodejs, and to not get error to setup IDE to ECMASCRIPT 6.
